Browse to the Access file or create a new one and click OK.
- To link data from an Access file into Word, go to the Insert tab and click Object. Choose Create from File and browse to the Access file. Select the table or query you want to link and check Link to file. Click OK and resize the object as needed.
- To send data from an Access file as an email attachment in Outlook, go to the File tab and click Save & Publish. Choose Save Database As and select Email. Select the objects you want to send and click Add. Click OK and choose a format for each object. Click OK again and Outlook will create a new email message with the objects attached.
