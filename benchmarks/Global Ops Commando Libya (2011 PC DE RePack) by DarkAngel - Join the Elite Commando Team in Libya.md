To import a vector image, go to File > Import > Vectors and browse for the image file that you want to use. You can use any vector format that ArtCAM Express 2013 supports, such as DXF, EPS, AI, SVG, etc. For this article, we will use an image of a dragon that we downloaded from the internet. After selecting the file, click Open and then click OK on the Import Vectors dialog box. You will see the vector image on your model.
 
## Step 5: Edit the Vector Image
 
To edit the vector image, you can use the tools on the Vector toolbar or the Vector menu. You can move, rotate, scale, trim, join, offset, smooth, or simplify your vector image.

## Step 6: Create a Relief from the Vector Image
 
To create a relief from the vector image, you can use the tools on the Relief toolbar or the Relief menu. A relief is a 3D representation of your vector image that can be machined by your CNC router or engraver. You can create a relief by extruding, beveling, sweeping, or blending your vector image. You can also apply different textures or patterns to your relief. For this article, we will use the Extrude tool to create a simple relief from our vector image.
 
## Step 7: Edit the Relief
 
To edit the relief, you can use the tools on the Relief toolbar or the Relief menu. You can move, rotate, scale, mirror, distort, smooth, or sculpt your relief. You can also change its height, angle, base height, or combine mode. For this article, we will make some minor adjustments to our relief and change its height to 10 mm.
 
## Step 8: Create Toolpaths for Machining
 
To create toolpaths for machining, you can use the tools on the Toolpaths toolbar or the Toolpaths menu. A toolpath is a set of instructions that tells your CNC router or engraver how to move and cut your material. You can create different types of toolpaths for different purposes, such as roughing, finishing, profiling, drilling, etc. For this article, we will create two toolpaths: one for roughing and one for finishing
