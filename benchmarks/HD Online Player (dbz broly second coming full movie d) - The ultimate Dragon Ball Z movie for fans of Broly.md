The movie then shifts to a flashback of the climax of Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan, where Goku defeats Broly with a powerful punch to the stomach. The flashback reveals that Broly managed to survive and escape in a space pod as New Planet Vegeta is destroyed by Comet Camori. Broly then lands on Earth, where he remains frozen for seven years.
 
Back in the present, Gohan struggles to fight Broly, who overpowers him with ease. Goten and Trunks join the battle, but they are also outmatched by the Legendary Super Saiyan. Videl returns with the Dragon Radar and finds that the four-star ball is stuck to Broly's chest. She tries to take it, but Broly knocks her away. Goten then notices that his father's picture on Videl's watch has been shattered, and he becomes angry. He decides to use his Kamehameha wave to blast Broly away, and Trunks joins him. However, their combined attack has no effect on Broly, who counters with his own Kamehameha.

Gohan intervenes and pushes Broly's blast back, creating a huge explosion. As the dust settles, Gohan, Goten, and Trunks are exhausted, while Broly emerges unscathed. He prepares to finish them off, but he is suddenly distracted by a faint cry of "Kakarot" from afar. The cry belongs to Goku, who has heard his sons' pleas for help from the Other World. He contacts King Kai and asks him to transport him to Earth for one day, just like he did for his fight with Majin Buu.
 
King Kai reluctantly agrees, and Goku appears on Earth next to his sons and Trunks. He is shocked to see Broly alive, and he realizes that he is the one who has been terrorizing the galaxy. He tells Gohan, Goten, and Trunks to give him their energy so he can defeat Broly once and for all. They comply, and Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan. He charges at Broly, who is surprised to see his archenemy again.
 
The two clash in a fierce battle, exchanging blows and energy blasts. Goku manages to land some hits on Broly, but Broly soon gains the upper hand and pummels Goku mercilessly. He then grabs Goku by the head and slams him into a mountain. He taunts Goku, saying that he will kill him and his sons, and then destroy the Earth.
 
Goku refuses to give up, and he gathers all his strength for one final attack. He unleashes a powerful punch that hits Broly in the same spot where he wounded him seven years ago. Broly screams in pain and agony as his body begins to crack and explode. Goku then fires a Kamehameha wave that finishes off Broly for good.
 
Goku collapses from exhaustion, but he is happy that he has finally put an end to Broly's rampage. He hugs his sons and thanks them for their help. He also thanks Trunks and Videl for their courage and friendship. He then tells them that he has to go back to the Other World soon, but he promises that he will always be watching over them.
 
Meanwhile, Shenron appears in the sky, having been summoned by the Dragon Balls that were gathered by Goten and Trunks earlier. He asks them what their wish is, but they are too busy celebrating with Goku to notice him. Shenron gets annoyed and decides to leave without granting any wish.
 
The movie ends with a shot of the Earth at peace, as Goku's voice narrates that he will always be ready to protect it from any threat.
