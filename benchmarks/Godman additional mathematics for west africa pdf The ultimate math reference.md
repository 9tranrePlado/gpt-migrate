Additional mathematics is a branch of mathematics that goes beyond the basic topics covered in general mathematics. It is usually taught as an optional or elective subject in secondary schools, especially in West Africa, where it prepares students for advanced level examinations such as the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) or the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Level. Additional mathematics covers topics that are useful for further studies in science, engineering, economics and other fields that require mathematical skills and reasoning.
 
**Why Study Additional Mathematics?**
 
Studying additional mathematics can have many benefits for students who are interested in mathematics or want to pursue careers that involve mathematics. Some of the benefits are:
 
- It develops logical thinking and problem-solving skills that are essential for many disciplines and professions.
- It provides a solid foundation for higher-level mathematics courses in college or university.
- It enhances the understanding of other subjects that use mathematics, such as physics, chemistry, biology, geography and computer science.
- It opens up opportunities for further education and employment in fields that require mathematical competence and aptitude.
- It stimulates interest and curiosity in mathematics and its applications in the real world.

**How to Succeed in Additional Mathematics?**
 
Additional mathematics can be challenging and demanding for some students, especially if they are not well-prepared or motivated. However, with proper guidance and practice, anyone can learn and enjoy additional mathematics. Here are some tips on how to succeed in additional mathematics:
